# Rain-Prediction-with-ML
In this project, machine learning algorithms with a classifier was used to predict whether there will be rain the following day in Australia or not.

We used a rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithms to the data.
The classification algorithms used to build our models are:
1.  Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM
   
The results were then reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics:
1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score


 
   About The Dataset
   
The original source of the data is Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and the latest data can be gathered from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/.

The dataset to be used has extra columns like 'RainToday' and our target is 'RainTomorrow', which was gathered from the Rattle at https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle/src/master/data/weatherAUS.RData

This dataset contains observations of weather metrics for each day from 2008 to 2017.
